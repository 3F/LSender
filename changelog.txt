[1.16] 2021.12.12

    * FIXED: Fixed possible NullReferenceException when lambda, ~Anonymously Hosted DynamicMethods.
    
    * NEW: Improved vector implementation which should be twice as fast as the original StackTrace instancing.
           
           Note the following,
           Actually it could be implemented even faster because only the vector matters in our case.
           This however is not trivial task due to some CLR protections such as
             ECall methods must be packaged into a system module when calling GetStackFramesInternal 
             which in turn requires StackFrameHelper instance.
           That's why it's still wrapped inside StackFrameHelper class.
    
    * CHANGED: Added LSR_FEATURE_S_VECTOR preprocessor directive to completely disable vectors 
               if it is not planned to use.
    
    * CHANGED: New project structure for distribution using source code 
                which makes it easier to split the repeater within the domain.
                
            For example,
            ```
              <PropertyGroup>
                <LSenderExtIncSrc>..\LSender\src\</LSenderExtIncSrc>
                <DefineConstants>LSR_FEATURE_S_VECTOR;$(DefineConstants)</DefineConstants>
              </PropertyGroup>
              <Import Project="$(LSenderExtIncSrc)src.targets" />
            ```


[1.15] 2019.10.21

    * NEW: Tracking via vector field (Vinf) inside MsgArgs.
    
    * NEW: +`bool MsgArgs.At(params string[] map)`: Are there any suitable directions in the vector.
    
    * NEW: +`bool MsgArgs.At(string name)`: Is there a suitable assembly in the vector.
    
    * CHANGED: `Message` sealed class has been renamed to `MsgArgs`.
